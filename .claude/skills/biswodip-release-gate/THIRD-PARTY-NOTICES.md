# Third-Party Notices

**Biswodip Goj Unified Engineering** is the orchestration and engineering system in this repository; it is licensed under Apache-2.0 (see `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`). The upstream projects below are **not** relicensed and are **not** the work of Biswodip Goj. Each is redistributed unmodified under its own licence, with its own `LICENSE` (and `NOTICE`, where provided) file preserved inside its directory.

The stack catalog (`integrations/catalog.json`) only **references** further projects by URL — nothing from them is bundled or redistributed here. Each keeps its own licence; check it upstream before you depend on one (css.gg, for example, uses a custom licence).

Snapshot commits, tree hashes and file counts are recorded in `upstream/SNAPSHOTS.json` and `integrations/manifest.json`. Verify them at any time with:

```bash
node bin/biswodip.mjs verify-package

## 1. Taste Skill

- **Source:** https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2026 Leonxlnx
- **Licence:** MIT — full text at `upstream/taste-skill/LICENSE`
- **Bundled at:** `upstream/taste-skill/` (unmodified snapshot)
- **Used for:** frontend design skills (Phase 8)

The MIT licence permits redistribution provided the copyright notice and permission notice are included. They are preserved in the bundled `LICENSE` file, and the installer copies that licence alongside any skill it installs (`UPSTREAM-LICENSE`).

## 2. Emil Kowalski Skills

- **Source:** https://github.com/emilkowalski/skills
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2026 Emil Kowalski
- **Licence:** MIT — full text at `upstream/emilkowalski-skills/LICENSE`
- **Bundled at:** `upstream/emilkowalski-skills/` (unmodified snapshot)
- **Used for:** design-engineering and motion skills (Phase 8)

> Correction to v1.2.0 of this package: an earlier note in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` stated that this repository exposed no OSI licence file. That is not correct — the repository carries an MIT `LICENSE`, verified at commit `85e8e23`. The note has been removed and the project is redistributed here under MIT with its notice preserved.

## 3. No AI Slop

- **Source:** https://github.com/petergyang/no-ai-slop
- **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2026 Peter Yang
- **Licence:** MIT — full text at `upstream/no-ai-slop/LICENSE`
- **Bundled at:** `upstream/no-ai-slop/` (unmodified snapshot)
- **Used for:** writing quality for UI copy, documentation and the release report (MASTER-PROMPT §43)

The upstream repository also contains `TERMS.md` and `PRIVACY.md` covering its ChatGPT/Codex plugin distribution; both are preserved in the snapshot.

## 4. Headroom

- **Source:** https://github.com/headroomlabs-ai/headroom
- **Copyright:** Copyright 2025 Headroom Contributors
- **Licence:** Apache-2.0 — full text at `upstream/headroom/LICENSE`; upstream `NOTICE` preserved at `upstream/headroom/NOTICE`
- **Bundled at:** `upstream/headroom/` (unmodified snapshot)
- **Used for:** agent context/token compression (Phase 9)

Apache-2.0 §4 requires that redistribution retain the licence, copyright, patent, trademark and attribution notices, and that any `NOTICE` file content be carried forward. Both files are preserved unmodified. Headroom's own `NOTICE` lists its third-party dependencies (tiktoken, Pydantic and others); those notices remain part of that file and apply to Headroom, not to this distribution.

## 5. Strix

- **Source:** https://github.com/usestrix/strix
- **Copyright:** Copyright the Strix authors (usestrix)
- **Licence:** Apache-2.0 — full text at `upstream/strix/LICENSE`
- **Bundled at:** `upstream/strix/` (unmodified snapshot)
- **Used for:** authorized autonomous penetration testing (Phase 11)

Strix must only be run against systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test. That obligation is part of using the tool and is enforced in this system by the guarded runner in `integrations/strix/`.
