description: Review or build a UI so it is complete across every state, responsive, accessible, purposeful in motion and free of generic AI styling and slop copy, using the Taste, Emil Kowalski and No AI Slop skills. Use when asked to design, redesign, polish, improve the UI or UX, check accessibility, or make an interface not look AI-generated.

# Design review — complete, accessible, and not obviously AI-made

Phase 6. Applies to any meaningful UI change. It never overrides security, correctness, accessibility or performance.

## Integrations

**Taste** — `design-taste-frontend` (new UI), `redesign-existing-projects` (audit before changing), `minimalist-ui`, `high-end-visual-design`, `full-output-enforcement`.
**Emil Kowalski** — `emil-design-eng`, `animate`, `review-animations`, `improve-animations`, `pick-ui-library` (before adding any UI dependency), `mobile-native`.
**No AI Slop** — `no-ai-slop` for every word that ships.

They are guidance, never permission to add visual complexity.

## Pipeline

1. **Understand the task** — the user's job and the business goal, not the screen.
2. **Audit what exists** — components, spacing, type, colour, states, patterns. Do not replace working UI blindly.
3. **Decide intent** — hierarchy, density, composition, motion. One direction, chosen deliberately.
4. **Build the smallest token/primitive set** the work needs.
5. **Implement every state** — loading, slow, empty, partial, large, error, validation, auth expiry, permission denied, rate limited, retry, duplicate submit, offline, success.
6. **Responsive with real content** — mobile, tablet, desktop; long text; localisation expansion.
7. **Review motion** — enter, exit, hover, focus, press, transition. Consistent easing and duration families, compositor-friendly `transform`/`opacity`, nothing perpetual, nothing that delays the task.
8. **Anti-slop pass** — remove meaningless gradients, glassmorphism, decorative 3D, random animation, fake dashboards, fake data, badge noise, fake progress.
9. **Copy pass** — `no-ai-slop`: lead with the point; actionable errors; no puffery ("enterprise-grade"), no weasel attribution, no fake-profound endings.
10. **Accessibility** — keyboard path, visible focus and sane order, semantic HTML, labelled fields, announced errors, WCAG 2.2 AA contrast, 24×24 min touch targets (44 preferred), accessible dialogs (trap, return, Escape), live regions, 200% zoom reflow, `prefers-reduced-motion` with an equally usable experience. Automated checks find a fraction — do the manual keyboard pass.
11. **Performance** — bundle impact, image sizes, layout shift, animation cost, unnecessary client JS.
12. **Security and regression** — visual work never becomes the authorization path; optimistic UI never implies a completed financial or security operation; business behaviour unchanged.

## Visuals and motion come from the project, not from a mood board

Before adding any image, illustration, icon set, 3D, video, background effect or animation, write one line: **what fact about this product does it show?** No answer → it does not ship.

| Building | Imagery that belongs | Motion that belongs |
|---|---|---|
| Website / web app | The real product: its screens, its data, its output, photos of the actual place, food, people or objects the business sells. Diagrams of the real flow. | Scroll that reveals the product's own sequence (steps of the booking, stages of the pipeline); hover/press feedback; state changes (added, saved, failed). |
| Mobile app (Android/iOS) | Real screens and the content users will see; platform icons (`@expo/vector-icons`, SF Symbols). No web hero graphics squeezed onto a phone. | Native gestures and transitions (`react-native-reanimated`): navigation, list insert/remove, pull-to-refresh, pressed states. Nothing that plays on a timer. |
| Tool, dashboard, dev product | Real terminal output, real config, real numbers from the system. | Data arriving, filters applying, a run progressing — driven by the actual state. |

Rules that follow from it:

- **Subject** — a restaurant site shows the restaurant; a CLI shows the CLI running. Abstract blobs, glowing orbs, particle fields, floating 3D shapes, stock "circuit board" or "AI brain" art, and random gradients are decoration with no subject — remove them.
- **Palette and type** come from the brand, the domain or the existing product — not the default neon-on-black or purple-to-blue gradient. If there is no brand, derive it from the subject (materials, place, audience) and write down why.
- **Every animation has a trigger and a meaning**: it answers "what just changed?" or "what comes next?". Looping ambient motion, parallax for its own sake and entrance animations on every block fail this test.
- **Placeholders are labelled** as placeholders, and the list of real assets needed goes in the report. Never ship generated "photos" of people, products or places as if they were real.
- **One library per job.** Use what the repo already has; add an animation or icon library only when the plan picked it.

## Never

Fake data to fill a screen · fake loading percentages · fake analytics · "AI-powered" labels with nothing behind them · client-side checks described as authorization · animation hiding weak information architecture · a design system package where a few tokens would do.

## Exit gate

- [ ] Every interaction has real loading, empty, error and success states.
- [ ] Keyboard-only walkthrough done.
- [ ] Reduced motion verified.
- [ ] Every image and animation names the product fact it shows; the rest was removed.
- [ ] Copy passed through `no-ai-slop`.
- [ ] Screenshots or notes recorded as evidence.
